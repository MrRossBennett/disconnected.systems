# How Linux Handles Storage

How disks are handled in Linux is based on some fairly simple building blocks
that can be assembled into some very complex layouts. In this post we will take
a look at what is going on under the hood at how the Linux Filesystem works and
how your files and directories are stored.

## Hardware

## Partition Tables

### Master Boot Eecord (MBR)

### GNU??? Parition Table (GPT)

## Filesystems

## Kernel Filesystem Drivers

### Block Devices

#### Loopback Devices

### Tmpfs

### Proc/Sysfs/Configfs

### Fuser

### Network Shares

## Filesystem Hierarchy

### The Filesystem Root and Kernel loading

### Mounting

### Bind Mounting
